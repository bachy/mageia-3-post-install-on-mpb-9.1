#Mageia 4 on macbookpro 9.1

i installed mageia 4 in dual boot with refit on my macbook pro 9.1.
I chose mageia because of the comunity-based, non commercial, multipurpose aspects of the project (also because i'm french :P)
And i am realy hapy with it so far, so thank you for all your work guys !

this is  my script collection as a note book about the installation of linux mageia 4 Gnome desktop on my Macbook Pro 9.1

/!\ you should read carrefully all the scripts before anything else 

/!\ i never ran directly the main script post-install-mageia3.sh, i follow the lines and type commands by hand on a console, other specific scripts can be executed

/!\ WORK IN PROGRESS

##share the same user uid between mac osx and linux
/!\ I decided to not do that anymore since i lost my systeme because of it (linux is not handling very well hfs+)
 
i'll continu the readme but until then, please follow the script sources.
